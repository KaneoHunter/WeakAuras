# WeakAuras

Collection of WeakAuras for use with the 3.3.5 version of [WeakAuras](https://github.com/KarazhanChessClub/WeakAura-3.3.5)

# Multiple Specs

Specs are difficult to track in this version of WeakAuras, if you want to use multiple WeakAuras for the same class, I recommend using the "Never" tickbox under "Load" to unload WeakAuras not currently in use.
